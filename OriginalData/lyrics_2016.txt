House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane

Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon

A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

Just the same way you showed me (You showed)

Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Verse 2]
"I'd die for you," that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
"I'd live for you," and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like "Who would you live for?" "Who would you die for?"
And "Would you ever kill?"

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
"Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was seven years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus]
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
"Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely"
Once, I was eleven years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

[Bridge]
Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

[Chorus]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
[Breakdown]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Somebody said you got a new friend
But does she love you better than I can?
And there's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, I bet she's around
And yeah I know it's stupid, but I just gotta see it for myself

[Chorus]
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oh oh
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh oh oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, oooh
I keep dancing on my own

I just wanna dance all night
And I’m all messed up, I’m so out of line, yeah

I’m spinning around in circles

4 ContributorsReed Dollaz vs. Chess Lyrics[Verse 1: Reed Dollaz]
I said, this is where the fun stop Chess
Gun pop, one shot'll make your lungs drop, Chess
All my niggas get it in, I'm from a dumb block, chess
Mortal Kombat, finish him; Kung Lao, yes
I ain't come here for play, I ain't come her for chatter
4 pound to the gut, put blood in ya bladder
All them niggas that you claim, when I aim
They gon' scatter, knock the gigs out your brain
Leave the streets full of data
Ladder hangin' out the bottom so you know what this .40 hold
I'll drag yo' bitch ass from White plains to Fordham Road
Cause if my young niggas from Edenwald, see you and give me a call
You're gettin' stripped down to your socks cause we need it all!
Now, what is chess? A game with 16 pieces, 1 king, 1 Queen
2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops and 8 pawns
So, I should hit your crib with this .16
Kill the Queen and King, merc you and your rooks at 2 at night
Like I'm Bishop wit this .8 long!
I got the Juice now, I mean you rap 'bout this killa shit
Well, pop out the proof now! Suck your faggot ass teeth again
I'll knock out a tooth now! Philly rap made you niggas
Before SMACK made it commercial and more calmer
I been had a fridge full of rappers like Jeffery Dahmer!
Scream "Allahu Akbar", crash your building like a bomber!
Stay with a crew of wild niggas who love to spark beef
They kill cats, fish, dogs, shit, pretty much anything with a heart beat
You guppies lucky, you never felt the wrath of the shark teeth!
Come to my block, Discovery Channel, it's Shark Week!
Aw sheesh, this AA-12 will squash beef, cause grief
Mama kissing your corpse; on ya hard cheeks!
Toss reefs in your grave, pussy nigga, rest in peace
Another young nigga that died for false reppin' these streets
And, all the critics say he's hard, but I don't see that shit
I got niggas that's doing life, we don't believe that shit
You're talking wild beef, shorty, you canal street
Won't sell me that shit! Haha!
I said, Marine pistol, let the sub-machine hit you
.223's, it's gonna feel like submarine hit you!
K got the Woodstock, A got a good shot
Brains hang, get your fuckin' name on a wood box!
This year, I'm murdering niggas, back to my old ways
In the trap, same Dickie on, 3-4 days
War with us, that's somethin' that you don't wanna go through
The judge shoot a fireball out, like GoKu
Bullets hittin' brick walls, trust me, it'll go through
You don't know the shooters, but nigga, the shooters know YOU
My pops was a Gun, I'm the son of a "G"
You're pops was a bug, you'se the son of a Flea
Your mom's is a bitch, you'se the son of a "B"
I'll send a spirit to the sun if nigga's want it wit' Reed

I finally got somebody I gotta body
I'm straight out the gate like God denied me
I told myself "Reed, gotta walk in dead"
And all it take is a head shot to drop a zombie
But, I was only have motivated
Then, I received dollars for Dollaz homi
So I had to spice it up for the chips, like the hottest Taci's
This my shit, you don't wanna see me
Try and stop me, when I tell him "Do something"
I don't mean find a hobby
You fin' to get a worse ass whooping that you got from Johnny
I don't believe none of them words, don't even try to try me
Get beat and boxed for story telling raps; Lodi Dodi
Nigga, this ratchet ring like if you wife a thottie
That was some bars from Chess
Was it my hardest? Yes, got him!
Is he Reed Dollaz, Reed dead or Reed done?
If we squeeze ours, he'll see lead from each one
He done walked into reality
But a head tap will make his dreams run!
Down his mind, literally, sovereignty
I came back to land left this King dumb (kingdom)!
See, I'ma fuck Reed up, no damn debating
The hammers blazing, one gotta beam, one gotta scope
2 different views like fans debating
Or I could I stop Reed, to give him a quick right (write) like annotations
Beware of what this man creating
Cause I don't train to get slept on, I'm not a homeless man in stations
Last Christmas, I got a gift of picking up trash; sanitation
Your era done, you can't stand with greatness
Only way you can hang with this roster (rasta)
Is if your man's Jamaican
These bald heads sick, that's a clip full of cancer patients
And a I gotta chopper arm like it was amputated
If he sees the .4 he's gonna dip like he ran from Jason
Or, a different weapon is popping, Hecklers behind him
Like his man's was hating
Wait, why was your man's just hating?
You ain't nobody nigga, your family's famous
Well, not no more but in 200 B.C., this man was blazin'
But, now this man is ancient and he dealing with a savage aak
Plus, all my raps is hot, get in his space
And leave Earth more often than astronauts
This finna to be more dreadful than Rich Gang, Migos, Future
Travis Scott
Lil Wayne, Lauryn, Bob Marley, whoever else have the locks
Tay running, his dame comin'
They still ain't trying to pass the Roc(k)
Fuck it, this a scrimmage, watch the basket drop
Leave this bastard's top wide open
But I'm the nigga who had the shot!
Hurt your boy with a .30 toy, a nasty Glock
Hope it don't jam on me when I have to pop
Cause the gun funny, it's a laughing stock!
Some think I force aggression, but it ain't false aggression
Nigga, I'm raw by mistake like the Magnum popped!
Get picked from the .30 like last drafting spots!
Now, that was hot! And ya'll really think Reed Dollaz ready?
Nigga, this chopper deadly, *makes chopping noise*
Sounds like a professional chef chopping veggies
I'll kick in his stomach, now everything on my feet is guts
Like a baby inside his belly
Or I'll cock the Desi, baow his brains look like Hot spaghetti
The pasta ready!
Face cut for the work, over weight, give him surgery
Like his doctor heavy
But that's light, I can Cave in it-
I took a shot at Roc already. Think about it
Where Jimmy at? I'm trying to see if the shooter and driver ready
What we gonna talk? Fuck that, Suge got machetes
He don't get the pumps, this Shotgun, getting sawed off!
Or, arms raise like let me speak, heart burn; Chess keep heat
Gun in his mouth, let him eat the burner
Like giving oral sex to a bitch with STD!
I took a life and I'll take a second like, "Let me think."
The .4 is high, hit his pupil, the shot? 'Fore his eye
He got shot before his eyes, I ain't let Reed blink
Cakes up! Wait, fuck! Let's bring the bars back
Let me guess, you couldn't bring it in here?
It's in the car, scrap? SMACK
We can take this battle to wherever the fuck he parked at!
"It's young Reed, Philly boom, I really prove"
Nigga, your gat what? You better back down fore' I back out
Cause, I don't take shit like I'm backed up
So, back up or we jumping jack, and leaving him like a jumping jack
Clapped up!
He think he at the top of food chain
Til' fool chain get snatched up
You said you'll fuck John John and called him moist?
That's mad sus', that's what you do dawg?
Let me move, ya'll
Cause John John the type of nigga I'll make a move on
John John the type of nigga you'll make a move on
But fuck fighting, if he move wrong, we ain't fightin'
I'ma shoot dawg, ya'll ain't catch it?
That's one of his moves, dawg
I was straight to the hammer, we don't do paws, nigga
You trash and you're a bitch, that's two flaws
For telling a couple stories, I'll knock him down two floors
Busted head, broken knee and a tooth loss
He won't get two fl- BRONX!
[Verse 2: Reed Dollaz]
I said, Cake Life, right? That's what you claim?
That's what you stand by? Word?
Well, I think all ya'll are bitches, pussy niggas need a tampon
This battle is war, you done stepped into a land mine
Yeah we both throwing them punches, but I land mine!
Shotty hit the floor, make the ceiling drop
Buckshot pellets make a nigga milly rock
I'm from the era where you had to be really hot
When you can only rap about guns that you REALLY shot
Nowadays, niggas lyin' on they Shmurda Gang
Making up guns, I ain't never heard the name
Stop lyin' nigga, you ain't never serve the 'cane
You had an after school job, talking crack, you the Burger King
Don't make me drive through, cock it, put the wop it to you
Yao Ming with the thing, shoot a Rocket through you
Big dog in the game, you a pocket poodle
Heard you was the plug lil nigga, I'll sock it to you!
I knew niggas was gonna bring up that in the car/John John shit
But before John John evolved, I was in John John's picks
On interviews they asked who inspired, I was on John John's list
That's why I never believe a bar that came out of John John's lips
Dwight Howard how I hug the block, rap Gods
We're the juggernauts, gun but you, give your jug a knot!
Nigga's is sick, you think the God won't bless you
This .4 pound will drop 9 on you like Van Exel, the blam stretch you
I'll pop it if you get too close or put the 7 on his chest
Like I shot Kukoč
I'm too dope, too real for this URL/Smack shit
Cause I be out in Philly in the trenches with the trap shit
.57, FN plastic, all black shit
A handgun with .223's; that's tragic!
Laser on it, no need for aim, I just go off beam
Top open, his top smoking, that's how you blow off Steams!
Don't make me hit your crib tweekin' wit' the trey pound out
Give you a pound out this trey to catch a Greyhound out
You fabricated and animated, your life a foosie
You kill niggas in bars, not wit' a knife or Uzi
We catch ya bitch in Co-op my youngin' light a doobie
Wes Craven when I'm wavin' the Wesson don't make me write a movie
I had them hitters, by the door by the peep hole waitin'
Clip full of bald heads like chemo patients
We killin' everything, dawg you won't leave no statements
Even though I got a lawyer that'll beat those cases
Sick of these fake fucks, 'bout to get they wings plucked
Faggot ass niggas runnin' 'round screamin', "Cakes up."
Dawg, where I'm from, that's some homo shit
Cause when her cakes up, it's bouncin' on my pogo stick
See this fo'fo' got a kick like a dojo flick
And we don't see no, hear no, don't know shit
I was about to hit y'all wit' this rap god scheme
But instead I'ma give y'all the definition of what a rap god mean
Y'all ready? Y'all ready?
It means I birthed and fathered you niggas right from the very start
I mean I died and bled for you niggas, I got a heavy heart
Losin' ya faith in the god is not very smart
Not I'm back to fuck up the globe and I talkin' every part
First stop, right to NY, straight to the Bronx wit' it
Right to Chess door, bow down, nigga this god given
Snatch Rex up by the collar, nigga y'all all seen it
Doomsday o'clock {crowd is too fucking loud to hear the rest}
[Round 2: Chess]
Round one, y'all think I was playin'?
Round two I'm finna tweak out insane
I aim and take this G out his game
Leave Reed red, a stomach shot will knock an E out his name
Game, I amaze the crowd on fuckin' sight
Frosty the Snowman, watch a cold, three round body come to life
Yikes
Bein' gentle in bed, I'm fuckin' nice
Reed, do what's fuckin' right
Put on for ya team, ya town...the Philly niggas doin' fuckin' life
Better pray for ya dawg Aak
This Philly nigga gonna get more bars than bricks of raw got
If it's war, then it's war Aak
Sharp shooters on the beach, get him sniped by the ocean, this a sure (shore) shot
Chin check him, get every nigga jaw dropped like they all shocked
Since you already losin' here, I'll put a round to your top like a bald spot
And if he talk hot, I stretch niggas, then put him back in place
Like, "Do your warm up then get in ya floor spot"
I bet he's an informer, snitchin' and givin' the law drops
Niggas drive by he the type to call cops
And put the pigs onto the plates, like pork chop boys stop
So you a fuckin' bitch and you a fuckin' snitch?
And y'all thought he was beatin' me? This nigga double lit
You don't wanna spit raps? Twin MAC's, I get it double lit
S-s-s-s-s-Smack, I ain't tryin' to copy respect, I'm tryin' to double it
Fuck ya clique, boy I'll chop ya legs off for tellin' me who runnin' wit
Nigga you wanna flip? Go call your connect then cut a brick
Or bag up a zip, cause I'm not the one you want it wit'
Half the shit he say, don't make fuckin' sense
His words, off track...so why he run his lips?
Just because you came prepared don't mean you gonna win
The handshake after this battle, don't mean we fuckin' friends
You in your bag? I'm in my fuckin' bin
Spend dollars on Dollaz, I'll put a check up on him like a worried friend
The old slammy, just like Reed, it got a rusty pin (pen)
Before I leave the crib I stuff the Glock, females workin' out her muffin' top
I dip after I tuck it in
It's still "Fuck NWX", Shine I scream blood again
And that lil' church nigga Saga just make me wanna sin
He wanna be closer to God-BLAOW, lucky him
Shut up nigga, let me watch my language, you an F'in' nerd
Hittin' me up for a battle, you got some F'in' nerve
I'll talk to you to give you my style
Cause after God speak, you supposed to spread the word
Reed chill, I'll be back to you in a second bird
You told Chilla since he the King Pen, he gettin' drugged
Lord, that's how I know you ain't seasoned
Cause I'm waitin' for Chilla Jones to give me a reason
To leave him, bleedin'
We can do it now, fuck the Prep, we both beat him
This nigga boastin' about Boston? Shesh, this nigga beastin'
Cause my niggas from Boston told me he a weak bitch, G shit
Type to get rocked dead in his mouth for speakin'
Get drugged lord, run in ya trap don't [?] with King Pen
I'm the truth and I get any nigga that lie buried
This his last battle, it's quiet, I'm puttin' Reed (read) on the shelf like libraries
I'm very, upset we didn't use a [?] problem
If I lose patience (patients), he gotta find a doctor
Loud ratchet, with a lil' one on the side that's baby mama drama
Rip ya daddy's spinal cord, baby from Dinosaur I'll knock the [?]
How he gon' deal wit' me? I done killed for free
I had a passion for this before I clocked dollars
I ain't one of them niggas that did this just for a buzz
I'm just addicted to rappin', B
You ever seen Faculty?
Well he knows the pen is a drug
When he gets rich, I bet he prolly spend all his money on the best whips
But when bread's involved you gotta use intelligence dough
So I be coppin' a regular car for detectives
Speakin' of detectives, check this
Like listenin' to somebody insult you
Keep hittin' him up like, "I really need somebody to talk to."
I be finna to take back like sore loser takin' the wrong move
I still know grimy niggas with loaded tools
Whatever they couldn't afford to text (TEC) book like poor students
Palmin' heat, takin' away from all fools for more food
Cause they gotta eat, I ain't sayin' that robbin' is all cool
But think ahead, they called Rex cause it's either you suck or rule (oral)

This that, nigga I'm back, now front and get smacked rap
Put the K over the shoulder, couple clips in the knapsack
Pop 30 and let the stock drop like NASDAQ
This ain't even a battle no more this real and fake
And since it is, I already won but niggas still debate
That .44 Mag will have the cops on a [?]
Cause the shot broke every bone in his skull, they couldn't tag a face
The first 48 we let the first 40 quake
Then ask his mom to help carry the casket at shorty wake
They got me back up on this Rambo shit, niggas in trouble god
K over the shoulder, deuce five in my bitch Wonderbra
Chess, you don't want it wit' me youngin'
Since when has it been cool to disrespect?
I'm yo' fuckin' OG youngin'
So when you win awards think of me youngin'
Cause if I wasn't fuckin' ya mom, without me you wouldn't be nothin'
Lyin' in ya raps how you be shootin' the .8
We checked his record, only prior was a truancy case
Nigga you lyin' (lion), play gorilla til you in the zoo wit' the apes
Niggas is hungry, can't bar 'em in cause they'll chew through the gate
That steel blow when the body drop I'll...
Heel toe wit' a steel toe boot on ya face
Lil' nigga you a child to me
When I see you I see I, damn, I'm so proud of me
And I don't rap for the crowd you see
Real niggas gon' love it, pussy niggas gon' stay quiet so fuck it
Six rings on like I'm MJ
All off the block like Dikembe
Kept a new whip like Kinte
Ballin' on these new niggas, pink hat where the brim lay
Try to count me out, how dare niggas?
Fourth quarter tongue out, scare niggas
Check the stats, how the fuck you compare
Niggas ballin' on niggas since Jordan had Air nigga
Throwback jersey and some 1's on
One false move then the gun's drawn
Bet five seconds left on the clock, better watch I'll drop when you niggas beater buzz drawn
I said, nigga king me now or should we wait 'til later?
Run through every rapper alive, trust me nothin' can save ya
I've been spittin' that fish scale you feel it it's in braille
So when I cross the finish line I fish tail
I've been hated, beaten, stoned and crucified
For tryin' to bring this east coast back to save you and I
And all the strip club Molly music has gotten to us
The late great Big, Stack Bundles, Pun was my influence
Step in the square I dare, I prepared ya nooses
East coast savior, the east coast mayor, the people rooting
I been givin' you mad bars in my music
He won a couple battles and he king overnight? Fuck is you stupid?
King of this URL nigga? That's blasphemy
Cause I'm the god so that's just somethin' I had to see
And fuck the mainstream, underground I'm glad to be
I'll rise on the seventh day, you'll bow to your majesty
Somebody tell Big Poppa I gotcha
Goin' Back To Cali like riots all up in Compton
{Chokes}
[?] drown a bitch in the tub til she perish
Drum clip like a wheel, hold a hundred like a Ferris
Talk that shit across the street, don't come near us
Might catch me out in DC thuggin', right up in Edgewood
With Mike D'Angelo nigga because my crack good
I fluff my pillows up, I made my bed good
Might hit a blue hood, might hit a red hood
Shit you might catch me anywhere long as the bread good
Might be in any club, long as my Sig good
Sig Sauer I hit 'em then call my lawyer
They try to ship me out Georgetown like I'm a Hoya
But the Coupe like white rice, inside like a goya
And I dropped almost close to a bean, no what I mean?

[Round 3: Chess]
I'm glad you ain't hop up in this ring for nothin'
You got experience on ya side nigga, teach me somethin'
I wasn't big on attention, I ain't fiend to be seen in public
And yeah I gained a lil' fame in this game but that wasn't the biggest reason of it
Started battlin' cause I needed niggas to black on
Like back home I knew this little girl, she was mad strong
Grew up in the poor house, her family did her mad wrong
She used to cut her body and cry herself to sleep to them sad songs
Her mother was an addict on smack, that her step pops used to smack on
He took the EBT card til the stamps and the cash gone
She had to steal outta stores just for somethin' to snack on
And even when her mom made food she had to use the same spoon that her mother put the smack on
Shit was rougher than shorty hair
Shit, if she was still around I would've brought shorty here
Just to show her somethin' different from the wars and tears
And all affairs gave her step pops a head shot cause she lost it there
Watched that man go after hittin' that apple, it ain't as peachy as it all appears (a pears)
39 wit' a birthday comin', the .40 near
Nicest to the trashiest, I'ma make 'em all aware
It's like my girl sad and I'm always there
I'm wipin' out all the tears (tiers)
I'm all types of savage
When I ain't have money for a chain, I had guys to snatch it
Pelle Pelle, if he wanted the icey jacket (ice he'd jack it)
My nation got no chill you can't stop my movement like I'm hyperactive
Get bad luck seat in the fire, that's white lighter habits
I ain't even wiggin' yet
I can raise spirits blacker than human form like a silouhette
Put this baby to sleep, my animals on his head like a pillow pet
This nigga knows I'm his biggest threat
But my slip ups will cause him to get shot if I keep chokin' I'm grippin' necks
Gettin' dirty wit' a sweet 16, like a B-Day girl in a shitty dress
Get him bum rushed, drugged and boxed like a homeless man on crystal meth
Get napped in here, black fist or the metal nigga, pick ya death
You 'bout it, 'bout it, nigga kill that
Play fightin', you ain't real scrap
T.I. beanies, the hollow TIP'll tilt hats
Steel clap
"Bro that nigga dead", I still clap
So the spirit that's leavin' his body can feel that
Real rap, I ain't kiddin' witchu homie
When I'm toastin' the cig' (Sig) at him, I ain't givin' him a bogey
Put a round to his head, two dots plus a cut, looks like a serious emoji
I don't miss shots, I'm hittin' niggas homie
If I Set It Off, one ratchet busts
Cause the only bitch to get away was Stony
When it was our time to shine we had to take risks (wrists)
And I'll fuck around and get him for his Rollie
Nigga you don't know me
Difference between us? You had yours in the car dawg
Nah, that's realistic, real shit
But I didn't have weapons in the ring
I'm hardcore, snap wit' raps, flippin' wit' bars like I'm parkour
Ghetto nigga side shot, look like I'm havin' trouble openin' the car door
That chopper in the street you better guard yours
Hear that Big Poppa in the field, that was Hard Ball (boy)
That shit came from miles away, and he ain't get the picture
In Hardball, Miles is the pitcher
{slight choke}
Listen nigga, I'm not one of them dudes you killed as a kid spittin' nigga
I'm from the south Bronx, I ain't south Bronx represented nigga
I feel sorry for the fans that ain't buy tickets nigga, they finna lose out
He got left ghost now it's boo or it's spooked out
Beat his ass, still whipped the tool out
Bullets kickin' out in the last second like a two count
Keep dumpin' the can' like I'm tryin' to get all the juice out
Mama's children behind the buildings lettin' kabooms out
I'm talkin' cannonballs in back of the crib without a pool house
Chess vs Gwitty, rappin' wit' gum
Boy I'm tryin' to see whatchu (chew) 'bout
All for havin' a loose mouth
Wreckin' you was in my Born Legacy
I was destin' to, Chess the truth
Respect ya elders? Nigga respect ya youthEmbed

I don't wanna tell 'em, let's surprise 'em

On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you

Darling, darling, oh, turn the lights back on now
We're watching, watching as the credits all roll down
And crying, crying, you know we're playing to a full house, house

'Cause I got me for life (Yeah)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul (Ah)
[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
'Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on

So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go apeshit
Say "Fuck y'all!" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy

Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

Come home early after class
Don't be hanging 'round the back of the schoolyard
I've been called up by your teacher
She said she can't even reach you 'cause you're so far
You've been talking with your fists
We didn't raise you up like this, now did we?
There've been changes in this house
Things you don't know about in this family

It don't make sense, but nevertheless
You gotta believe us, it's all for the best
It don't make sense
The way things go
Son, you should know

Sometimes two homes are better than one
Some things you can't tell your sister 'cause she's still too young
Yeah, you'll understand

And nothing's going to change with your old friends

231 ContributorsLost Boy Lyrics[Verse 1]
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, "Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely"
And ever since that day

[Chorus]
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
"Run, run Lost Boy," they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

[Verse 2]
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

[Bridge]
Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook
Neverland, I love you so, you are now my home sweet home
Forever a Lost Boy at last

And for always I will say...

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland

39 ContributorsHurts So Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
You fight me off like a firefighter
So tell me why you still get burned
You say you're not, but you're still a liar
'Cause I'm the one that you run to first

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time, yeah, why do you try to deny it?
When you show up every night and
Tell me that you want me, but it's complicated, so complicated

[Chorus]
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good

[Verse 2]
Every time that I swear it's over
It makes you want me even more
You pull away and I come in closer
And all we ever stay is torn

[Bridge]
Wide awake through the daylight
Would you hold me like we're running a yellow light?
Reach for you with my hands tied
Are we dancing like we're burning in paradise?

[Chorus]
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?

I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains

[Pre-Chorus]
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh

Without thinking of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever I wanted to

(Oh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky fall to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losin' hope
But somehow, baby
You broke through and saved me

[Pre-Chorus]
You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

[Chorus]
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy
Holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you

[Verse 2]
You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killin' my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singin', babe, hallelujah
We'll be touchin'
We'll be touchin' heaven

I don't need the stars 'cause you shine for me
Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy
You're my ecstasy

[Chorus]
You're holy, holy

I'm high on lovin' you
High on lovin' you
You're holy, holy

Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feelin' low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil 'cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up a new performance

They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplyin' ten
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get

Weight, shape her, I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tartar, I'ma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient

All because she got her own dough

She could never ever be a broke ho

She's the baddest, straight up vicious, texting her and asking her
If she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures, she said no (what)
Well goddamn, she said come over and see it for yourself
Never asking for your help, independent woman
She ain't for the shelf
No, she's the one
Smoke with her till the weed is gone
Stayin' up until we see the sun
Baddest ever, I swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done
Never borrow, she ain't ever loan
That's when she told me she ain't never ever ever ever gonna be owned

To say and do whatever I please

They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there

J’ai poussé à fond sur l’étau mais où est vous ?
L’entente de son nom me donne chaud, mais qui êtes vous ?
C’est vrai que j’ai des, sur mes côtés même sur ma song
Mais au final mes sentiments t’attendent
Là je prends le risque, on fera le grand saut tonight

[Refrain]
À nouveau toi dans ma zone
À nouveau toi dans ma zone
Dans ma zone
Cette fois j’le fais et pas demain
Cette fois j’le dis et pas demain
Fais le tranquille et sans lеs mains
À nouveau toi dans ma zone

[Couplet 2]
Et d’un coup certainеs te déteste, elles valent pas une pièce
Ensemble on est loin et oui c’est le Neuer
Ne fais rien, non ne fais rien
J’veux pas avoir affaire à ces riens
Où manger, où aller tout tes goûts j’connais bien
Et rouler à Paris jusqu’après minuit
T’es à tout mes shows
J’croise tes yeux dans l’lot
J’perds tout mes doux mots
Dès qu’tu m’attrapes c’est fini, c’est fini

Boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight

[Chorus]
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

[Verse 2]
Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To be fly as a mother
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie, cause undercover
He's gonna save my life like Superman

Hola, holana

She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?", she said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all
She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?", she said "Konnichiwa"

Every time I come around man, I go for broke

Now baby you gon' go where you pos to go
'Cause I ain't got time for you every day
She said she got a man keep it on the low
I said he don’t speak English, fuck he gon' say (Aye)

[Produced by Pop & Oak and Sebastian Kole]

[Intro: Isaac Hayes]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So, tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
You might also like[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
[Bridge]
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here407Embed
