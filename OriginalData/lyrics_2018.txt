This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (Fighter)
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort, oh
And all this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been silent for too long

Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one and I've been quiet for too long

[Verse 2]
I'm in need of a savior (Savior), but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough

I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

150 ContributorsBe Alright Lyrics[Verse 1]
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright"

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

[Verse: Drake]
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
TrapMoneyBenny, ayy
I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny
From the block like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many

[Intro: Ozuna]
(Jeje, woah-oh; Au-Aura, jaja)
No va a ser tan fácil (Fácil, fácil)
Aunque me esquives, comoquiera
Tras de ti, voy tras de ti (¡Ti, yeah!)
Tú tienes todo lo que quiero para mí

[Pre-Coro: Manuel Turizo]
Y tú tan sola por ahí
Detrás de ti voy a seguir
Yo sé que lo bueno toma tiempo, lady

[Coro: Ozuna & Manuel Turizo]
Es que me gustas tú na' más
No me importan las demás
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por más que intento no se va
Me gustas tú na' más
No me importan las demás
Una vaina loca que me da
Que por más que intento no se va

[Verso 1: Ozuna]
Me gustas tú na' má', no sé disimular
La música que hago solo en ti me hace pensar (¡Woh, oh!)
Única, una rosa; yo me la quiero robar (Baby)
Sencilla, bonita; no se tiene que maquillar
Me mata el piquete, baila duro y le mete
Con nadie se compromete y meno' si tú le promete'
Tiene lo que quiero (Woh); me tira', que yo le llego (Yeah, eh)
No sé disimular, bailo contigo y yo me entrego
Me mata el piquete, baila duro y le mete
Con nadie se compromete y meno' si tú le promete'
Tiene lo que quiero (Woh); me tira', que yo le llego (Yeah, eh)
No sé disimular, bailo contigo y yo me entrego

Yo viajo el mundo entero
Si es por ti, no hay pero
Siento que por ti desespero
Cuando no te tengo, ma'

6 ContributorsToma Bebé (Remix) LyricsLetra de "Toma Bebé (Remix) ft. Nio García, Juhn, Casper Mágico & Anonimus

[Verso 1: Juhn, Nio García]
Ella me llama cada vez que puede
O manda a la amiga cuando no se te atreve (-treve)
Está comprometí'a según to'as las redes (Evo Jedis)
Soy de su religión el pecado

Me dice que de amor nadie se muere, no (no)
Prefiere estar sola que mal acompaña' (ah-ah)
Que siga hablando que mi voz la pone mal
Que le llegue a su casa, que ya la tengo mojá'

[Coro: Lenny Tavárez]
Ella me pide (pide, wuh)
Que cuando me la coma (coma)
La mire y la acaricie (wuh)
Y que le diga "toma, toma, toma bebé"

[Post-Coro: Lenny Tavárez, Anonimus, Juhn]
Pídeme otra vez
Toma bebé
Te vo' a complacer
Toma bebé (okay, okay)

Pídeme otra vez
Toma bebé
Te vo' a complacer (este es Juhn El All Star baby)
Toma bebé
You might also like[Verso 2: Juhn]
Toma, lo puse en la mesa pa' que entero tú te lo coma'
Pide lo que tú quiera' que a mi cuenta de banco yo le sumo coma
Ella me saca la leche, más rápida que la bala e' una pistola
Y hay que tener par de peine engacha'o
Pa' guerrear con ella un par de horas (wuh-wuh-wuh, ay)
Salvaje, me dice al otro día que le tiemblan los pies
Que le haga lo que yo quiera, que el marido nunca lo ve (ve)
Le metí en la cocina, baño, también en la sala (sala)
No mandó a la amiga pero ella no dice nada (jajajajaja)
Y le volví a meter de camino al hotel
Y ella pidiendo a grito' que le diera despacito
Me la volvió a ofrecer, dijo "Toma bebé"
Vuelvo y esa la como (wuh-wuh)
Mientra' foto' le tomo (wuh)

[Verso 3: Lenny Tavárez]
Nunca nos enamoramo', esa es la nota en que andamo'
Tu novio no sabe que tú eres mi chilla los viernes después de las cuatro
Nunca nos enamoramo', esa es la nota en que andamo'
Se dobla pa' que vea el tatuaje
Que tiene en la espalda y me ponga bellaco

[Puente: Lenny Tavárez]
La habitación se prendió en llama'
Tú y yo haciéndolo hasta por la mañana
La tengo tan caliente que parece que bota flama
Y me dice al oído que le meta con gana'
La habitación se prendió en llama'
Tú y yo haciéndolo hasta por la mañana
La tengo tan caliente que parece que bota flama
Y me dice al oído que le meta con gana'
[Coro: Anonimus, Lenny Tavárez, Lenny Tavárez & Casper Mágico]
Ella me dice (Anonimus)
Que cuando me la coma (wuh-wuh-wuh)
La bese y la acaricie
Y que le diga "toma, toma, toma bebé"

Ella me pide (wuh, pide)
Que cuando me la coma (coma)
La mire y la acaricie (wuh)
Y que le diga "toma, toma, toma bebé"

[Verso 4: Nio García]
Tanto me lo pide
Es imposible que yo te olvide
Cuando estás bellaca soy la solución (wuh)
Me llama' y le llego a tu habitación
Sin llamar la atención, uh, yeah
Déjame la puerta abierta que voy por La Habana a noventa
Tranquila que si alguien nos ve, yo sé que un cuento te inventa'
Enrolamo' y prendemo' un blunt, cogemo' un arrebato cabrón
Te lo quiero volver a poner, yo sé que tú quiere' lo mismo que yo
Dímelo, yo sé que conmigo tú quiere' chingar en la suite
Como yo, tú sabe' que ninguno de ello' te hace venir
Como yo, tú sentir, como yo
Y por más que to' el mundo la quiera, ese culo se lo como yo
[Verso 5: Anonimus]
Contigo se hace la santa y conmigo es una bellaca
Tú la tiene' rogando, conmigo llueven las paca'
Le gusta escuchar "Esclava" cuando se arrebata
Ella sabe que yo soy el que la maltrata

[Puente: Anonimus]
La habitación se prendió en llama'
Tú y yo haciéndolo hasta por la mañana
La tengo tan caliente que parece que bota flama
Y me dice al oído que le meta con ganas

[Verso 6: Casper Mágico]
(Los de La Magia)
Mi baby me dice (dice)
Que me quiere chingar como si mañana ella no me volverá a ver
Que me venga y que le avise (le avise)
Que me va a matar las ganas antes del amanecer (Casper)
Ella me dice (uh), que cuando le vaya a dar (ah)
Que baje con las perco' que se quiere empercosear
Quiere que le jale el pelo, quiere que la trate mal
Que me va a chingar bien rico y que nunca la vo' a olvidar (jaja)
Me dice "Toma", se pone en pose pa' que la coma
Y si no se lo meto, se me encabrona
La cojo, la pongo en cuatro
El bumper como caja de Tacoma (uh, ah)
Y vuelve y me dice "Toma"

Takeoff, I'm the bird keeper, let the birds fly
Why you tryna take my prize? You a dead guy
Of course, I gotta keep a watch out through my bird eye
No casket, drop dead fresh and I got dead guys
Don't discriminate, ball players come in all sizes
Finger roll, post move or the pick and roll
They mad the way we win, they think we used a cheat code
Why you keep lookin' at me?
I feel like niggas got static
It must be the Patek
Pockets blue cheese, I'm in the kitchen

Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissin' him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's callin' me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the Garden State
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah

M, M, M

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
The curtains drawn, shawty X-rated
You're purpose-grown, the world's greatest
I see no flaws, so let's face it (huh)
No Roseanne Barr, despite the ratings
She's independent (huh), I'm willing to spend it
Let me book the flight (boss), [?] the night
Before we turn the page so many quotes that I like
You inspire so much that I write
She's my van Gogh, such a work of art
This where my love lies in this sensitive heart
So what's your name? Tell me your number
This such a cold game, you all I want this summer

[Chorus: Khalid & Normani]
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
For my whole lifetime

You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen

So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

[Verse 3: Normani]
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?

Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

[Verse 2]
And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly, but you need some imagination

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose, then I lose

It's you, babe

KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals," bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, "Okay"
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to

Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose

I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott
[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you

I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

[Chorus: Kelsea Ballerini]
They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want and if that's really so wrong

Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost

[Verse 1]
So tired of sleepin' alone
So tired of eatin' alone
I need to ask her what's goin' on
Are we goin' strong?
She felt like resting her head
My shoulder was the perfect height
We fit so right, so what's goin' on?
'Cause I've been undone

The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find, it's true
The road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me, you make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it
We both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Verse 2]
We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

[Verse 1: Hugh Jackman, Ensemble]
Woah
Ladies and gents, this is the moment you've waited for
Woah
Been searchin' in the dark, your sweat soakin' through the floor
Woah
And buried in your bones, there's an ache that you can't ignore
Takin' your breath, stealin' your mind
And all that was real is left behind

[Pre-Chorus: Hugh Jackman, Ensemble]
Don't fight it, it's comin' for you, runnin' at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
Your fever dream, can't you see it gettin' closer?
Just surrender 'cause you feel the feelin' takin' over (Oh)
It's fire, it's freedom, it's floodin' open (Oh)
It's a preacher in the pulpit and your blind devotion (Oh)
There's somethin' breakin' at the brick of every wall that's holdin' (Oh)
All that you know, so tell me, do you wanna go?

1 ContributorFAST BOY Lyrics[XD]
Tou sempre em primeiro não canto soprano
Eu sou mais velho mas não sou humano
Mexo vossas damas nem sou amapiano
Cause I got the keys nem toco piano

Esta é minha ERA nem canto Divano
Tou a dar gás não é metano
Nigga é melhor tu teres cuidado
Te acabo num estalar de dedos Thanos

Já te disse q tou a fazer movimentos
Nem peguei no bumbum mas entrou no compasso
Ela disse q queria um macho
Lhe fiz direito pra fechar o caso

Não pode esquecer q sou moçambicano
Reclamo de tudo e tudo ta caro
Não tenho uma casa mas eu tenho carro
Dou beers e carnes lhe mamo no carro

Disseste q tua dama era fulana
Mas tem damo se não me engano
Y'all girls like my pipe
Por isso dizem q tenho nkanu
You might also likeFriendzone é lixado mano
Melhor vc se atirar memo
Caso com a pita dos teus sonhos
E ela te convida para seres damo

Uh bebé zangou
Uh já ta binhado
Uh queres o quê
Uh quer rebuçado

Meu coração não é sorvete
Mas o gajo é gelado
É o q acontece quando todos te querem mas ninguém te gosta
Tipo Coca light

[Refrão]
When I was 10 boy. I was fat boy
Now I’m bad boy. The Get the cash boy
The stole yo girl boy. Oh you too slow boy
I got the flows boy. They call me fast boy fast
2x

[AM]
Yeah, estamos na race
Me and my G's gotta keep up the pace
O nosso plano sempre foi sermos greats
Um dia estaremos a puxar os wraiths
Yeah, groovar em Marrakesh
Então bato barras para ter o cash
Amarrar esses kets, catch up with the best
Controlar o game tipo Kendrick man
BKG está full de real ones, nunca há espaço para yes man
2020 não se mete muita água, ppl vai ficar like Damn
Yeah a pita muita areia para o truck mas não sabe que sou o sandman
Muitos clowns no mesmo space, is 1AM, gotta kill em man

I'm coming in quick, I strongly advise you my nigga to standback
Or we goin clash, I think you don’t want no problems with my clan
Temos movimentos pra te dar tarreia, punchlines like Jackie Chan
Te deixar todo zululwana, começar a chamar-me de Badman

[XD]
Ouvi dizer q Jr já ta grande
Agora até faz música
Não é malcriado??
Ó tia eu também quero ser pago
Não é diversão só eu quero salário
Tu não sabes nada de liberdade
O bom não é fácil e isso é verdade
Don't want no smoke
Deixa lá mbangue
Foca te em entrar e sair da faculdade

[AM]
School vai ser sempre uma dificuldade
Embora dê mais oportunidade
Mas é no PC que sinto liberdade
Produzir é o que gosto de verdade
18 barras eu sou maior de idade
When I was 10 era só chocolate
Agora tua dama na chamada
AM é a hora da verdade

Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with the cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you (Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do (Even though I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('Cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (Isn't what it could be)

It's just a thing you make me do

Yeah
I'm working on dying

[Chorus]
I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

[Verse 1]
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)

That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)

Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it

Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga
[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?

I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Yeah, we're united under our indifference

81 ContributorsMake Me Feel Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, don't make me spell it out for you
All of the feelings that I've got for you
Can't be explained, but I can try for you
Yeah, baby, don't make me spell it out for you
You keep on askin' me the same questions (Why?)
And second-guessin' all my intentions
Should know by the way I use my compression
That you got the answers to my confessions

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I'm powerful with a little bit of tender
An emotional sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better
There's nothin' better

[Chorus]
That's just the way you make me feel
(That's just the way you make me feel)
That's just the way you make me feel, uh-huh
(That's just the way you make me feel)
So good, so good, so fuckin' real, uh-huh
(So good, so good, so fuckin' real)
That's just the way you make me feel
(That's just the way you make me feel)
That's just the way you make me feel

You know I love it, so please don't stop it
You got me right here in your jean pocket (Right now)
Laying your body on a shag carpet, ooh
You know I love it so please don't stop it (Ah, ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I'm powerful with a little bit of tender
An emotional sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better
There's nothin' better (Oh)

Good God, I can't help it, ah
Hey, that's just the way that I feel, yeah
Please, I can't help it
[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I'm powerful with a little bit of tender
An emotional, sexual bender
Mess me up, yeah, but no one does it better (Oh)
There's nothin' better (Better)
Damn

29 ContributorsI’ll Be There Lyrics[Verse 1]
When all the tears are rolling down your face
And it feels like yours was the only heart to break
When you come back home and all the lights are out
And you're getting used to no one else being around

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I'll be there
When you need a little love, I got a little love to share
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come through
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you

[Verse 2]
When it's Friday night and the drink don't work the same
And you're alone with yourself and there's no one else to blame
When you still can't feel the rhythm of your heart
And you see your spirit fading in the dark

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I'll be there
When you need a little love, I got a little love to share
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come through
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you (I'll be there for you)
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
You might also like[Bridge]
When you're lost down the river, babe, I'll be there
When you're lost in the darkness, I'll be there
I'll be there when your heart is breaking
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there

[Chorus]
I'll be there, I'll be there for you (I'll be there)
I'll be there, I'll be there for you (Ooh, ooh, I'll be there)
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you (Oh, oh, oh)
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
(I'll be there when your tears are falling)
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
(I'll be there, can't you hear me calling?)
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two
(I'll be there when your heart is breaking)
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you, ooh

[Outro]
I'll be there for you, ooh
I'll be there for you, ooh
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you, ooh
I'll be there for you, ooh
