When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

[Pre-Chorus]
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul who could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh

So baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'

Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

(Hey) Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)

Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better

Oh, my love
Can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise
When you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love
Can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could
Convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

She said, "It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"

You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt

Hey stupid, you're listening to Bazooka tooth, dental cannons, molar pistols; shit like that
This is Murs, motherfucker, this is Aesop Rock, Ace Rizzle. Ya know what I'm saying? Check it out, like, Living Legends, Def Jux, if you don't know, now you're informed
Be better prepared for the next time this type of shit goes down. Cause when it's happening and you're unaware you look like a complete asshole
(Baddest motherfucker touching down on kick drums)

Every leader dead and it's making you upset
La da de dah da da, La da de da da da dow dom

Every hero dead and it's making you forget
Get, get, get

[Verse 1]
I'm in and out a pig channel serrated for hand feeders
Army of vicious kitchen patrol yam peelers
They sleep in barns and whisper loony conspiracy secrets
Increasing payroll awareness blind while a.w.o.l. went the leaders
The only mammal officially banned from food chain comp
For finishing for over 25 consecutive years on top is aggravated
Alarmingly, the pulse don't bump right
And he's up nights
Bumping over crunk and bug bites
Who luck like this evening?
Stay electric mud blood jockeying for the footing
My last supper starts with a vinaigrette over pickled Muppet hearts while sheep tuck deep in the wood chipper
For the shepherd was a milk carton and scissors
Clammy hands make henna run on risky jenga tugs: you're all sweating, Hell I'm sweatin' too, just ain't nobody sweatin' you!
(Holmes!)
The muck went abacus on labor perspirator official biz
When auditioning demos by which to live
No whammies, Stop
Your triple six game never chose me
Trickery gets hokey
Pick up sticks and ponies
You've got mail, champ: blow me
Just trooper with a question mark machine needy
Pointed at the heavens like a Bee Gee on some where the hell's my freebee?
To clamp war stupid
No landlords or super
No hands
Water no ice cubes Rubik, no plans
No motor movement, no dance, no pyrotechnics to enhance
No chance
Too many grown men call in sick over cramps
I weigh in heavy on the jaded bitter subtracting the frontal gimmick
I want to solve world hunger and fuck a pin-up
I want to find a 21st century carbon crutch worthy of pedestal placement and shitty path walking to touch

[Verse 2]
Ain't no time to sit and lift stones
So it's left to the dogs to find their way home
And you grew up in a similar generation alone
With a fist full of humanoid models along the road
But a blank and you're ancient
Fuck if I can find a flesh and bone tour guide to edge me through the makeshift
Every little footprint’s faded and vacant
Now I stomp through this motherfucker impatient

For the first time in a long line of dog fights
Little Lassie will not be returning home tonight
They’re saying someone everclear spiked the punchbowl of Christ but all I saw was six pits ripping throat box out her life
Live lizard lung out a this ain’t Kansas cause
Where the lemmings run with scissors to the closest open jaws
Pause
Open the fucking door Hal, it’s your valid mistake
I will not bow to a god that I can’t look in the face
It go C-4 tongue and a janky ankle
He still escort an Eeyore to the seafloor, thank you
Please curb your Egor
Alto spas Alcatraz to the peace core
Anti bleep. Anti sheep
Sword anti sheathed for corroded shoulders to lean toward
Short ‘em, sort of report consecutive awkward moments like Gandhi and Hitler stuck in elevators broken
One could reach the ceiling panel boosted by the other, but suddenly suffocating doesn’t seem all that stubborn
Is you with it? It’s brick Timb on eggshell percentages
Only mobile at but a trotter’s clip
No dial tone or walking stick. Fostered chickies peel back a placenta with broke posture for the daily dun da da’s done didn’t glow proper
From the promised land abortion of keepers and bleeding orphans
Where only the megas creep outside the box to seize the fortress
I and my crew seek an informal enforcement passage after receiving a timeline laced with tutor muter packages. Come on baby, act with us. The other activists, refusing to pour dummy accusations to the aqueducts
These are the days when the flotsam and the jetsam part ways trying to convince the players to fuck the game
But we don’t want to trouble you
We take no for an answer
If and only if enhanced with 'k' and 'w'
We’re only warning kitten paws who want escorting through the jungle zoo
This little industry will buckle you

Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Goin' places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Runnin' out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

Late-night when you need my love

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touchin' road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife

Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now, I need someone to breathe me back to life

A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina

Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless

Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas

Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights, mm
That I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest
A masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams

I used to be so happy, but without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left, but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me, but I feel there's somethin' you should know

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

'Til the day I die

[Verse 2: MNEK]
Funny how we both end up here, but everything seems so right
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So, what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind? (Take you off my mind)

And I don't want a never-ending life
I just want to be alive while I'm here
And I don't want a never-ending life
I just want to be alive while I'm here
And I don't want to see another night
Lost inside a lonely life while I'm here

[Chorus]
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
But the gun still rattles
The gun still rattles, oh
But the gun still rattles
The gun still rattles, oh25Embed

If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if I’m not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

And I'll be me

[Bridge]
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

[Breakdown]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

[Outro]
Come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Intro: Isaac Hayes]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So, tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
[Bridge]
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
