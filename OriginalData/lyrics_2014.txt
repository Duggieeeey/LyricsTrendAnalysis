94 ContributorsNight Changes Lyrics[Verse 1: Zayn, Liam]
Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: All, Harry]
(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis, Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars"

Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find

And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

Lovin' can hurt, lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down

Denyin' every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn, All]
And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between

[Chorus: Harry, All]
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

[Verse 2: Niall, Liam]
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

Saturday mornin', jumped outta bed and put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet all the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand to ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah (Yeah)

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' till the day I die
"Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!"

[Chorus]
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Marry her anyway
(Marry that girl) Yeah, no matter what you say
(Marry that girl) And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?

[Verse 2]
I hate to do this, you leave no choice, can't live without her
Love me or hate me, we will be both standin' at that altar
Or we will run away to another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me, she will go anywhere I go

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

Can't be sleeping, keep on waking
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning, inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

[Chorus] (x2)
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me!

[Verse 2]
Can't you see it? I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
I had no choice in this, I was the friend she missed
She needed me to talk

[Chorus] (x2) + [Drop]

[Bridge]
Oh I'm so sorry, so sorry baby
(I'll be better this time)
I will be better this time
I got to say
I'm so sorry
Oh I promise

I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

And I want you, we can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on, doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you, we can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it

Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it

Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind
I cannot find the way outta here

All her life, she has seen
Oh the meanest side of me
They took away the prophet's dream
For a profit on the street
Now she's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow
All his life, he's been told
He'll be nothing when he's old
All the kicks and all the blows
He won't ever let it show
Because he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

You've been working every day and night
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly

Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand, my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got ninty-nine problems but you won't be one, like what?

I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs
Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, dazed and kinda lonely

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind

Tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missin' you

You know you feeling, how your boy press play
Just keep that ass rewindin'

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl, I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuckin' like no other

Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

She been plottin' on me for a cool minute
She wanna' suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like girls in the shower, when it's winter fresh
It’s some Twitter pussy, I met on the Internet
On my late-night thirsty, ‘cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no bailin'
I keep a stack of hundreds, I can keep a secret
If anything you was explorin', you wasn’t cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin' game
YOLO, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho

139 ContributorsDon’t Lyrics[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
[Verse 3]
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love

Home of the party and the trees
Sunny la-land of the G's, please let a nigga breathe
Tank top top down for the breeze
Burnt lips, got a blunt full of weed, peace, love, enemies
Nigga, I ain't come for the beef
You ain't know she came for the skeet? Got pipe for the cheeks
Nigga, I'm the life of the beat
Fuck that, this year gotta eat, bou-bounce for the crown
You be hating and I still hold it down
When you 'round, man, the girls never lounge
Man, I heard you a hound
Bruh, man, that bitch need a pound
Tip-tip-tip bounce out her gown, hands high to the sound
Yeah-yeah, I'm the rich nigga now
Bitch, I'm the talk of the town, make a bitch run her mouth
Yeah-yeah, go south for the boy

Weed cards every corner sell herb, what's a fly to a bird?
Nigga, I could pitch you a curb, uh
Let this real shit occur, make mills from a verb
Nigga cop a crib in the burbs, nigga
You ain't said nothing but a word, smoke something for ya nerve
Home of the paid on the first
Then nigga going broke by the third, bou-bounce for the crown
Fast forward getting real tell me now
Every dog need a cat to meow, every once in a while
I see hands in the crowds
See whites, blacks blazing a pound, jump-jumping around
Tits, ass bump out her gown
B-bounce from the ground, hype for the sound
This verse straight from the morgue

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

[Verse 2]
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth

Cheated and lied, broken so bad
You made a vow, never get mad
You play the game, though it's unfair
They're all the same, who can compare?
First you lose trust, then you get worried
Night after night, bar after club
Dropping like flies, who woke you up?
On the front lawn, sprinklers turn on
It's not your house, where'd you go wrong?
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

[Chorus]
Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

First things first, I'm the realest (Realest)
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (Let 'em feel it)
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm giving lessons in physics (Right, right?)
You should want a bad bitch like this (Huh?)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (Yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist (On my wrist)
Taking all the liquor straight, never chase that (Never)
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back (What?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spilling, you should taste that
[Chorus: Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I said baby, I do this, I thought that you knew this
Can't stand no haters, and honest, the truth is
That my flow retarded, each beat dear, departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop in no department
And get my money on time, if it ain't 'bout money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that I give that line a rewind
Said I get my money on time, if it ain't 'bout money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that

Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that (Ooh)
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that (Ooh)
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that
That's just the way you like it, huh?
It's so good, he just wishing he could bite it, huh? (Say what?)
Never turn down nothing
Slayin' these hoes, gold trigger on the gun like

I won't give up, I won't give up
I won't give up, I won't give up

[Verse 1]
And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one

[Pre-Chorus]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

[Chorus]
Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

Yeah, let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doin' everythin' I can
And another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

Take a moment for yourself
Get close with the lights down low
You and I and no one else
I get the feeling that I wanna explode
Baby you grab my attention
Tension burning, fever high
Take me to another dimension
Tonight the rules do not apply

[Hook]
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive

[Verse 2]
This is where I wanna be
Hands up, feel the bass in my heart
Give me faith and I will leap
I take the risk cause you're never too far
Right now I'm drowning in emotion
Caution flies right out the door
Baby you're pushing this devotion
I can only ask for more

Boy toy named Troy
Used to live in Detroit
Bi-bi-big dope dealer money
He was gettin' some coins
Wa-wa-was in shootouts with the law
But he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen
He was keepin' me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse
Bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who-who-who-who wanna go first?
I had 'em pushin' daffodils
I'm high as hell
I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

Let him eat it with his grills, he keep tellin' me to chill
He keep tellin' me it's real, that he love my sex appeal (Hey)
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab (Hey)

Can you feel it? Now it's coming back
We can steal it if we bridge this gap

When I lost it, yeah, you held my hand
But I tossed it, didn't understand
You were waiting as I dove into the waterfall

And you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall
And you rushed to me and it sets us free
So I fall to my knees at the curtains of the waterfall

Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, what's going on?
But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming
You're just another day that keeps me breathing

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothin' to something, liking to lovin'
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believin' what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singin' this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

And forget about the stupid little things

So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Did you see her?
She's so short, and that dress is so tacky
Who wears Cheetah?

I'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders
I give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent
At Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxing at Happy Camper
It's the fucking (financial aid) at Hamptons wasn't relaxing, I'm taxing
"Fuck 'em all!"'s what I'm chanting, don't complain, I'm just ranting
Fuck ranking, I'm the best, I'm the champion's chariot
I'm a liar like Carrey in Liar Liar
I'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott, cable guy like Larry
Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies (Fucking fairies)
I'm using my tooth bait to get that bitch teeth paste
Fuck it, Odd Future some Nazis (Nazis), black Nazis don't copy (Copy)
We perfect, you sloppy (Sloppy), hotter than Saki Takei (Takei)
Fuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet
Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett (Bitch)
Hang with thrashers and jackers, drug dealers and crackers
AP students and slackers, I'm backwards
Like Jermaine Dupri in '93, escaping from concentration camps
With a fucking girl board and a ramp
That I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS
Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress (Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress, bitch)
With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny
Sup on my hat like that motherfucker friendly
White red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie
She dino like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me (Yup)
Fuck You Bunch is here, never disrespect my family
That’s for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie (Auntie)
Wasted fucking youth? All you old niggas antiques
We go skate, rape sluts and eat donuts from Randy
Bitches like Tia Landry watching Billy and Mandy (Watching Billy and Mandy)
Motherfuckers wanna be Odd but you can't be (Can't be, heh)
Sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot (Faggot, ayy)
I guess I got to be a fucking hand-me-down rapper
From Los Ange' area anytime I'm fucking landing
Fuck (Fuck) 2DopeBoyz and NahRight
Shoutout (Shoutout) to Hype Trak, them motherfuckers could never get rid of me
Guess I gotta do a fucking song with Dom Kennedy
Get these fucking hip-hop bloggers to start feeling me
Because I'm seventeen, compose my own beats
Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine
Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fucking skinny jeans
And follow in your footsteps like a motherfucking millipede
Centipede, make songs about Gucci and ciga-weed
Jerk with my freshmen like it's some motherfucking little league
No, I'm not no fucking hipster, mister
No, I'm not no fucking Kid Cudi, all my fucking fans love me
Collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies (Fuck buddies, O-F)
Yo, yo
I'm driving in a stolen truck, and I'm probably fucking drunk
Wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, DJ Unk (Uh!)
My nose is filled with coke and my license is revoked
(Shut the fuck up!) Who the fuck told me not to spoke? (Me)
Fuck everybody here, everybody vanished
I'm managed, hop off my dick and make a fucking sandwich
Everybody listening can suck my dick in Spanish
(You know what? Fuck you) Fuck you (Shit), faggot (Fucking bastard)

38 ContributorsGhost Lyrics[Chorus]
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

[Verse 1]
My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah it's still burning

[Chorus]
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
You might also like[Verse 2]
Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
'Cause I love living innocent
Oh, you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learned

[Chorus]
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

[Post-Chorus]
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, stop the haunting baby
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, no more haunting baby
I keep going to the river...
[Chorus]
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake73Embed

39 ContributorsNot A Bad Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Said, all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

[Pre-Chorus]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now, you're bleedin'
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you're worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now, how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every mornin', I just wanna see you starin' back at me (Staring back at me)
'Cause I know that's a good place to start
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]

It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
(Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me)

[Bridge]
No, I won't fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, you'll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

[Chorus]
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
