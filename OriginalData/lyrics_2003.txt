[Intro]
Go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip Bacardí like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday

[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, then the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed, hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey, nigga, roll that weed up (Roll that)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A., they sayin', "50, you hot" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)
Now shawty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Uh-huh)
Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay)

[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryna pull me back, right?
When my joint get to bumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me, "Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up"
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be
[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Hahahaha)

[Outro]

I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Takin' their time right behind my back
And I'm talkin' to myself at night because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind, behind a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus]
And the message comin' from my eyes says, "Leave it alone"
[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it comin' back my way, I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do

[Pre-Chorus]
And the feelin' comin' from my bones says, "Find a home"
[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm goin' to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me and I will think no more

[Pre-Chorus]
And the stains comin' from my blood tell me, "Go back home"

How can you see into my eyes
Like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb

[Pre-Chorus: Amy Lee]
Without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

[Chorus: Paul McCoy & Amy Lee]
(Wake me up) Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside
(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) Before I come undone
(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become

[Verse 2: Amy Lee]
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me (Oh, oh-oh)
Breathe into me and make me real (Make me real)
Bring me to life (Bring, me)

[Chorus: Paul McCoy & Amy Lee]
(Wake me up) Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) Wake me up inside
(Save me) Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) Before I come undone
(Save me) Save me from the nothing I've become

Frozen inside (Frozen inside)
Without your touch (Without your love)
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life (Only you, life)
Among the dead

[Verse 3: Paul McCoy & Amy Lee]
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself

I am a little bit of loneliness

On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

[Verse 2]
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, so we can—
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]

The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends

And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?

You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now, we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)

I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone tryna find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Tryna figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you, mmm

14 ContributorsSomeday Lyrics[Verse 1]
How the hell'd we wind up like this?
Why weren't we able, to see the signs that we missed
And try to turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists, and unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing's wrong
Just as long
As you know that someday I will

[Chorus]
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now
I know you're wondering when

[Verse 2]
Well I'd hope that since we're here anyway
That we could end up saying
Things we've always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror

There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down

3 ContributorsHot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential "Yo! MTV Raps" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Always see it on T.V.​
Or read in the magazines
Celebrities who want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talking about how hard life can be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall, they would fall, fall...

[Chorus]
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining, always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions, think we should rob them

[Verse 2]
Well, did you know if you were famous you could
Kill your wife? And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were
Smoking crack, McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.​

But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see

[Verse 3]
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holler at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her when I'm done, I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit (Trick)
[Chorus]
I don't know what you heard about me (Yeah)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Woo)

Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a lil' bit
I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal

Livin' my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her (Ooh-ooh)

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows, but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I hoped you were comin' home to stay

Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

And I don't bring the problems from the '90s into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'mma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave. shopping spree's, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now

And you ain't flattered by Canary and VS dipped Jesuses

You don't let them kinda numbers impress you

Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special

Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

You probably think that I hold resentment for you

I am to pull through

Don't fool with the player with the cool whip
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit
Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, let me put you in the mood, and
Little cutie, looking like a student
Long hair with your big fat booty
Back in the days, you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her up with some pimp-pimp fluid
Mommy, don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch Clueless

Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
'Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me

Knocked up 9 months ago
And what she finna have? She don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no Rock n' Roll
She want platinum or ice and gold
She want a whole lot of something to fold
If you a obstacle, she just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad, and these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told her "Girl, look here, calm down, I'mma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan, cause you's quick to learn
We can make money to burn if you allow me to lay this game"
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name

[Verse 2:  Cody Chesnutt]
I don't ask for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow roots standing where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine

[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]

It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right

And Black Thought is bad, these streets he done ran
Ever since when the game began
I never played the fool, matter of fact, I been keeping it cool
Since money been changing hands, and I'm left to shine

They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

[Verse 1: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
Baby girl, you know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you, gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin' lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit' her
It might sound like I'm gassin' ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin' just to keep it from leakin'
We so deep in our freakin' that we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonder why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright, if y'all bump heads, it'll be a fight (Mmm)
But I said it'll be alright, c'mon

Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry 'bout you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin' I denied

Mm

[Verse 1: Christina Aguilera]
So, what, am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Whoa)

Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's alright though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'

[Verse 1: Craig David]
I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties
I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before may go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same
'Cause with the money came a different status
That's when things change
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

Now I don't even wanna please the fans

Given advice that was clearly wrong
The type that seems to make me feel so right
But some things you may find
Can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places
And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away
When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you
The shape of my heart?

Back shot, proper or low can't stop us
Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch
I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I speed it up, straight beat it up
.. and I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin up a sweat strokin

You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug

My left stroke's the death stroke

I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
Blaow! We ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance

That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest

Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12-pack of Coronas - plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Rd
I'm already blowed, hit third I'mma be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet looking like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
It's three girls on the elevator like: "wassup?"
I told em: "follow me". they knew I had it cracking B
One said "ain't you that boy that be on BET?"
"Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped with much ding-a-ling"
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head is toxic waste
It's some pretty girls in hurr, I heard em whispering
Talking bout "that's that dude that sing "Right Thurr" - he glistening"
I ain't come to talk, I ain't come to sit
What I came for was to find out who I'm gonna hit, aww shit

Man know what, get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said "can I be in yo video" I'm like "yeah!", "oh really?"
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wilding
Sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little "D" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, with a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again

I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe
And no safe place to put my head
When you can feel the world shake
From the words that are said

[Hook]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

[Refrain]
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up

[Verse 2]
I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up
Some kind of hope inside of me

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

[Bridge]
When children have to play inside
So they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies
'Cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing queens (I won't give up if you don't give up)
And losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want (I won't give up if you don't give up)
Is only what we want until it's ours

[Hook]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

[Outro]
And I'm calling all angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
And I'm calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)
(I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)
Calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)9Embed

I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into
Morning just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me

[Chorus]
Oh Mandy
When you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
When you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

[Verse 2]
I'm standing on the edge of time
I walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
Tears are on my mind
Nothing is rhyming

Yesterdays a dream
I faced the morning
Cryin' on the breeze
The pain is calling

Oh Mandy
When you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
When you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today

When you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
When you kissed me and stopped me from shaking

Oh Mandy, don't you let me throw it all away

61 ContributorsGossip Folks Lyrics[Intro]
Yo, yo yo move out of the way
We got Missy Elliott coming through
Girl, that is Missy Elliott she lost a lot of weight
I heard she eat one cracker a day
Girl, well I heard the bitch was married to Tim' and started fuckin' with Trina
I heard the bitch got hit by three zebras and a monkey
I can't stand the bitch no way

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
When I walk up in the piece
I ain't gotta even speak
I'm a bad mamajama
Goddammit, motherfucker, you ain't gotta like me
How you stuntin' these hoes?
Need to talk, what you know
And stop talkin' 'bout who I'm stickin' and lickin'
Just mad it ain't yours
I know y'all poor, y'all broke
Y'all job just hangin' up clothes
Step to me, get burnt like toast
Motherfuckers, adios, amigos
Hop, hop, pose, pose
I don't brag, I mostly boast
From the VA to the LA coast

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
When I pull up in my whip
Bitches wanna talk shit
I'm drivin', I'm glidin', I'm stylin'
And these motherfuckers ask, "Did you see it?"
I'm grippin' these curbs
Skrrt, did ya heard?
I love 'em, my feathers, my furs, ahh
I fly like a bird
Chickenheads on the prowl
Who you tryna **** now?
Now you ain't gettin' loud
Better calm down 'fore I smack your ass down
I need my drums, bass, high hat
Has to be my snare, strings, horns, yes
I need my Tim' sound, right, left

Who I’m gon' roll up in the club with then report that next week
Just wanna see who I am ****, boy sniffing some coke
I know by the time I finish this line, I'ma hear this on the radio

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind, no one gave a shit
Knowin' he could rap, no one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smellin' like Burberry cologne
Still ridin' chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect, you'll give me
Ludacris, I live loud like Timmay (Uh)
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache, and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head tucked tight
Sprayed, so I never let the bedbugs bite
Hard to the core, core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Yahh!

Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real
I know, I know, I don't really care about her being pregnant by Michael Jackson
You know what we should do?
We should go get her album when it come out
There she go, there she go, there she—
Hi Missy
Hi Missy?
What's up fools?
You think I ain't knowin y'all broke, Milli Vanilli
J.J. Fad wannabes ain't over here gossipin' 'bout me?
Yo, how bout you buff these Pumas for twenty cents
So your lights won't get cut off
You soggy breasts, cow stomachs
Yo, take those baby GAP shirts off, too
You just mad 'cause Payless ran outa plastic pumps for the after party
Yo, by the way, go get my album
Damn

10 ContributorsPut That Woman First Lyrics[Intro]
Ooooh, ooh, whoo, whoo, ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
If they gleam in the sun
While they spin and they fit on my truck then (​​I could remember)
And if it came in the sack
No stems no seeds in the bag girl (I could remember)
And if they drip from my wrist and they look like they shine like new then
{​​I could remember}​​
But ohhh, girl
I forgot to be your lover
If it wasn't for the 9 to 5
Double-up overtime then (​​I could remember)
If it wasn't for the Sunday All-Star Weekend games, girl (I could remember)
And if it wasn't for the dough
Gettin' 50 G's a show, girl, ya know that (I could remember)
But silly me, silly me
Ohhhh
Tell me how could I ever forget to be your lover
Now I realize that you need love too (Oh, yeah)
Spend my life makin' love to you
Oh, girl
Oh, I forgot to be your lover

[Chorus]
When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (Oh, brother)
Findin' numbers in her purse
Better put that woman first (Yeah)
And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Oh, no)
When she starts playin' little games
Comin' in late from work
You better put that woman first

If it wasn't for the make up on my shirt
Still I'd be chasin' skirts then (​​I could remember)
And if it wasn't for that fight last night
You smashin' out my headlights then (​​I could remember)
If it wasn't for parole
Steady duckin' my P O girl you know (​​I could remember)
But silly me, silly me, babe
Tell me how could I ever forget to be your lover
Now I realize that you need love too
Spend my life makin' love to you
Oh, girl
Oh, I forgot to be your lover

[Chorus]
When she starts bringin' up old dirt (Bringin' up old shhhh)

Better put that woman first (You better put your woman first)
And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Oh, yeah)

Comin' in late from work
You better put that woman first (Put that woman first)

{​​So many times}​​ Actin like it wasn't really nothin'
{​​So many ways}​​ Kept to myself, always runnin'
{​​So many games}​​ All that I sin
{​​So many words}​​ I need you to stay
{​​Always came first}​​ Even though sometimes fallin'
Second
{​​Came down to love}​​ You know I had to win the last race
{​​Spend some time}​​ Put in some work
{​​And for better or worse}​​ Always put that woman first
[Chorus]
When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (Gettin' worse)
Findin' numbers in her purse (In her purse)
Better put that woman first (Put that woman first)
And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Ooh, yeah)
When she starts playin' little games (Her little games)
Comin' in late from work (I'mma say it again)
You better put that woman first (Put that woman, put that woman first)
When she starts bringin' up old dirt
And the fights keep getting worse (She's gonna leave you)
Findin' numbers in her purse
Better put that woman first (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you know she ain't wearin' her ring (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When she starts playin' little games (Yeah, yeah)

Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance, mmm
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said, ooh, she fell in love

[Chorus]
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Misguided heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love

[Chorus]
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Open this door)
Surprise, it's time (Yeah)
To feel what's real, what's real
What happened to Miss Independent? (Oh)
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you (Old you)
When love, when love is true

[Bridge]
When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of "Why can't that be me?"
I'm so glad I finally see
[Chorus]
What is this feelin' taking over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Oh yeah)
Surprise (Surprise), it's time (Yeah)
To feel (To feel) what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive (Yeah)
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you
When love, when love is true

18 ContributorsCome Undone Lyrics[Verse 1]
So unimpressed but so in awe
Such a saint but such a whore
So self aware, so full of shit
So indecisive, so adamant

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm contemplating, thinking about thinking
It's overrated, just get another drink and

[Chorus]
Watch me come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
And I'm your son
I come undone
I come undone

[Verse 2]
So rock 'n roll, so corporate suit
So damn ugly, so damn cute
So well-trained, so animal
So need-your-love, so fuck-you-all

I'm not scared of dying, I just don't want to
If I stopped lying, I'd just disappoint you

I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
And I'm your son
I come undone

[Bridge]
So write another ballad
Mix it on a Wednesday
Sell it on a Thursday
Buy a yacht by Saturday
It's a love song
A love song
Do another interview
Sing a bunch of lies
Tell about celebrities that I despise
And sing love songs
We sing love songs

They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
The young pretend you're in the clouds above the sea
I've come undone

You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one

This is for the grown and sexy, uhh
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh
Yeah, can I get my grown man on for one second?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be hanging with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to trot, lady!
Excuse me miss, what's your name?
Can you come, hang with me? (Ooh, oh)
Possibly, can I take you out, tonight?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You already know what it's hittin' for
Ma, I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin' on
50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off
Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin' is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST
Who else you gon' run with? The truth is us
Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us,
It's the Roc in here!
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at an airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Everybody's like, "He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!"
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
You might go, you mighta gotta go get you some Scooby Doo's
Lady
Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Gotta throw on Scooby Doo's, hehehehe
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh
This for the grown and sexy, only for the grown and sexy
So hot to trot, lady, what's your name? Ooh, oh
Woo!
You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done
...but I'm done readin' for now
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role
I'm 'bout to give you all the keys and security codes
'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin'
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

Disco dancin' with the lights down low
Beats are pumpin' on my stereo
Neighbour's bangin' on the bathroom wall
You're sayin', "Crank the bass, I gotta get some more"

[Refrain]
Water's runnin' in the wrong direction
Got a feelin' it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Something funny's goin' on inside my mind
Don't know what is pushin' me higher
It's the static from the floor below
And then it drops and catches like a fire
It's a sound I, it's a sound I know

It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes 'round and 'round
Into to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and 'round
It's the sound of the under, sound of the underground

It's such a shame, but I'm leaving (Uh)
Can't take the way you mistreated me (Uh)
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce

Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh

The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)

I wouldn't know how to say
How good it feels seeing you today
I see you've got your smile back
Like you say, you're right on track
But you may never know why
Once bitten twice is shy
If I'm proud perhaps I should explain
I couldn't bear to lose you again

[Chorus]
I think I better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I better leave right now
Feeling weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Yes, I will
I think I better leave right now, I'm feeling weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me out before I fall any deeper
I think I better leave right nowEmbed

11 ContributorsWhy Don’t You & I Lyrics[Verse 1: Chad Kroeger]
Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, "Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again"
So I say, "Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in"

[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]
When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around

If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all?

I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I could stay in your arms?

[Verse 2]
If I don't need you, then why am I cryin' on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
Or tell you that
But if I didn't say it, well, I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

[Chorus]
But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

[Verse 2]
I know I left too much mess and destruction
To come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

I'm looking in the mirror at this woman, down and out
She's internally dying and knew this was not what love's about
I don't wanna be this woman the second time around
'Cause I'm waking up, screaming, no longer believing that I'm gonna be around
[Pre-Chorus]

And over and over I cried, I don't know why
And over and over I tried, yet over and over, you lied
Over and over I cried, I don't know why

Lord, won't you take this pain from me?

I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe, babe

See, I don't wanna hug my pillow late at night no more

Ain't nothing here to keep me warm

Whoa! (Whoa!) Whoa! (Whoa!) Whoa! (Queen Bee, Mobb Deep)

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
I been gone for a minute now I'm back at the remix
Lil' Kim, Mr. Cheeks, M-O-B mix
Pump the Jag, come through in the V6
By the end of the night, I'm in the G5th
All we wanna do is dance
The way I eat tracks, call me Ms. Pac-Man
And if the fans don't fit in the minivan
Murk out in somebody's Sedan
You thought the Sprite can was off the meter
Imagine what I'd do with a two litre
You see my nipples gettin' hard through the wife beater
Fuck the tele, we can do this in the two-seater
Got every color diamond in the cross
I ain't scared to crossover, ya'll niggas is soft
My man follow me everywhere of course
To hear my theme music, muthafuckin' "The Jump Off"

[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Mr. Cheeks]
This is for my peeps, with the Bentleys, the Hummers, the Benz
Escalades twenty three inch rims
Jumpin out the Jaguar with the Tims, keep your bread up

And live good, East coast West coast worldwide
All my playas in the hood stay fly
And if your ballin let me hear you say right (Right)

I run with a mean pack, sticky green jack
Mobb Deep and 'em, we fam, got the Queen back
Peep the situation, the jump is jumpin' off
I'm on the low in the cut touchin' somethin' soft
Ain't nothin' like it, sex, weed and cash
I love gettin' smashed, I love hittin' ass
Floss back, smells good and toes out
Bought the bottles of Hen rock, and Moes out
Every spot we go in, it blows out
Queen Bee got hot shit, yeah no doubt
Listen, we keep it poppin' in here
Ain't no stoppin' in here

[Verse 3: Havoc]
It's the Jump Off remix with Mobb up on it
Since Quiet Storms niggas had them blocks, had them corners
Them Glocks, them revolvers, them problem solvers
Niggas fallin' in love with these hoes and fallin'
Yo', this is Havoc talkin' to a professional nigga
Talkin' 'bout guns, though he just ain't credible
Come to sets with Lex and the duke
And here's the catch, if you never had that itch
You won't squeeze for the scratch
You know how many in the hood bleedin' for that
While you talkin' out your ass and are weak with the tech
Lil' Kim is still that bitch
Burn everything I love, let a nigga stunt on me and the grub
We hide up in back of the club, you know we got a mint
Somethin' to make a shotie look like a Snub
Shorty if you ain't jumpin' it off, the fuck out
The last ain't you ain't leave, buggin' the fuck out
[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Prodigy]
My whole life is one party with millions of jump offs
And Bunsy called before a nigga jump off
Niggas wife be the next man jumped on
She pissed at you, the man has some fault
All she wanna do is feel loose
And free to be herself, we fuck like animals
There's a celebrity orgy at the crib
Call Kim and the mo'fuckin' Beehive crew
They got the whole bar and me armied
Too much pussy, nigga be drunk of punnani
A Brooklyn-Queens thing, when we get it poppin'
Gun fire couldn't stop us from rockin'
Certain niggas can't live they life
They can't party with us, 'cause they scared of they own kind
We in the jump off everytime
Like eight or nine deep with them things and the whole nine

The quiet one, with good intentions
He was down for his brother, respectful to his mother
A good boy
But good don't get attention

The brightest kid in school, he's not a fool
Readin' books about science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
'Cause smart don't make you cool, whoa

Stupid bitch standing there while I'm drinking my Henn'
Steady looking at me, still asking questions
Time's up, nigga, pass me another contestant
Ho, move to the left if you ain't 'bout 50
Done talked through 3 or 4 songs already
Looking at a nigga with your palm out
Bitch, I ain't even seen you dance
Twerk something, baby, work something, baby
Pop your pussy on the pole, do your thang, baby
Slide down that bitch a little bit, then stop
Get back on the floor, catch your balance, then drop
Now bring it back up, clap your ass like hands
I just wanna see your ass dirty dance
Yin Yang, we done done again
And put it on the map like "Hahn!"

[Chorus: Big Sam]
3-6-9, damn, you fine
Hoping she can sock it to me one more time
Get low
Get low (Get low)
Get low (Get low)
Get low (Get low)
To the window (To the window)

Till the sweat drop down my balls (My balls)
Till all these bitches crawl (Crawl)

[Interlude: Lil Jon]
Yeah, y'all twerking a little bit, ladies
But you gotta twerk a little bit harder than that
Now right now, I need all the ladies
That know they look good tonight
We want y'all to do this shit like this

Bend over to the front, touch your toes
Back that ass up and down and get low (Get low)

Back that ass up and down and get low (Get low)

6 ContributorsDon’t Wanna Try Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
They hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it, four years go down the drain
Oh, how I wish things would have happened so differently
I tried to save us so many times, but still, you couldn't see
You kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
And you're tryna come back home
You're tellin' me you really need me crying
Beggin' both knees are on the floor
But baby, I

[Chorus]
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, I've about just had enough
It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love

[Verse 2]
You and I had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Had to wake up, face reality
It all just seem too good to be true after all you put me through

8 ContributorsAngel Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been five months since you went away
You left without a word and nothing to say (Nothing to say)
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you, no
So I asked God

[Chorus]
God send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry (Is cry)
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

[Verse 2]
And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that, I still love you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
'Cause my heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries
So, God

[Chorus]
God send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry (All I do is cry)
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
(Send me an angel)

Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep
You made me feel like I could not breathe
Now all I wanted to do was to feel your touch
And give you all my love (give you all my love)
But you took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now, but you can't have it
So, God

[Chorus]
God send me an angel (Send me an angel)
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes
Oh God, send me (God send me an angel)
An angel (Wipe the tears from my eyes)
Oh baby

19 ContributorsYear 3000 Lyrics[Verse 1]
One day when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there was my neighbour called Peter
And a flux capacitor

[Pre-Chorus]
He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah, Yeah

[Chorus]
He said "I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed
But they lived underwater
And your great, great, great granddaughter
Is pretty fine"

Is pretty fine

[Verse 2]
He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Triple breasted women swim around town
Totally naked!

20 ContributorsHole in the Head Lyrics[Verse 1: Mutya]
Seven hours since you went away
Eleven coffees, Ricki Lake on play
But late at night when I'm feeling blue
I'd sell my ass before I think of you
Seven hours since you closed the door
Started a diet, got a manicure
Erased your number from my telephone
And if you call me, I won't be at home

[Pre-Chorus: All, Mutya]
They say
Why you cry-y-y
For the guy-y-y?
Say goodbye
Run away
Why you cry-y-y
For the guy-y-y?
Say goodbye
I said OK, cause

[Chorus]
Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head?
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy
And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy
Such a fool boy

Eleven hours on a brand-new day
I'm getting ready to go out and play
It's late at night, I'm caught in a groove
I'll kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue
Seven hours, what you calling for?
A bunch of flowers and I'll slam the door
You're in my face, sorry what's your name?
Takes more than begging to reverse my brain
'Cause

I ain't crying over you
Better fill your head up like I told you

And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy

[Verse 1: will.i.am & Fergie, Both]
Girl, me and you were just fine, you know
We wined and dined, did them things
That couples do when in love, you know
Walks on the beach and stuff, you know
Things that lovers say and do
"I love you, boo", "I love you too"
"I miss you a lot", "I miss you even more"
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But then something got outta hand
You started yellin' why I would break plans (What did you say to me?)
Even though I had legitimate reasons (Bullshit)
You know I had to make them dividends (Bullshit)
How could you trust your private eyes, girl?
That's why you don't believe my lies and quick to say

So why has it got to be so damn tough?

Of love; showin' him the love that you be givin'
Changin' up your livin' for a lovin' transition (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
Screamin' at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin', "Who the hell?!"
