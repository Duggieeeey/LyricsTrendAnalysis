I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting
Higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses askin' 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're tryin' to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm tryin' hard to take it back

[Pre-Chorus: Nate Ruess]
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like fallin' down
I'll carry you home

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together at Skyfall
At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

That without them, you feel like nothing

You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu

Or wherever to get away from me

Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through

Because I really fell for you

I'll be there for you

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
See Train LiveGet tickets as low as $58You might also like[Verse 2]
On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now, here you are again
So, let's skip the "How you been?"
And get down to the "more than friends" at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but that one night
Is still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
[Bridge]
Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

[Breakdown]
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause...

[Chorus]
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by29Embed

Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better
To never ask why

[Chorus]
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try

[Bridge]
Eh, eh, eh

[Verse 2]
Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy?
Even when it's not right

[Chorus]
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try

And does it make you wanna cry?

Are you just getting by?
Tell me, are you just getting by, by, by?

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame

59 ContributorsGirl on Fire Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy
Lonely like a highway
She's livin' in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe
But she knows she can fly away

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burnin' it down
Oh-oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backin' down

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walkin' on fire
This girl is on fire

[Verse 2]
Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls, say

Oh-oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burnin' it down
Oh-oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not comin' down

This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walkin' on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

[Bridge]
(Oh) Everybody stares as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lightin' up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)

Mmm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Instrumental: Snoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa - "Young, Wild & Free" (feat. Bruno Mars)

[Chorus: Jason Chen]
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV
So what we eat late
That's how it’s supposed to be
6-2-6, young, wild, and free
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV
So what we eat late
That's how it's supposed to be

[Verse 1: Andrew]
Hey, let me tell you about a place out east
Just Fifteen minutes from the LA streets
Hollywood doesn’t even know we exist
Like it's a mystical land, filled with immigrants
The food's authentic, the price is perfect
Where restaurants focus on the taste not service
Be ready to share 'cause it's family style
Time with the fam, makes granny proud!

We're far enough from LA where nobody's actin' phony!
Except maybe on our taxes, it’s cash only!
Tell the health department stop hating
’Cause a B rating stands for better tasting
Where kids drink more milk tea than liquor
And they roast more duck than Swishers
It's the 6-2-6, man check the address
Home of Sriracha and Panda Express

[Verse 3: Andrew & David]
Sometimes I wonder, am I still in America
How come there’s still a language barrier?
If you need help, read Yelp, check the reviews
My Elite friends make it easy to choose
There's traditional rivalries between high schools
They started back when there was still some white dudes
No matter where you go they can't match the price
So you're always coming back to the Cafe Life
If J-Town's got sake and K-Town soju
What do we have? Oh yea we got bobas
Hot spots to get some, hot pot and dim sum
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
From Shanghai to Saigon, Tokyo to Taiwan
Beijing to Hong Kong something to bite on
Valley, Atlantic, Garvey, I drive on
3 in the morning, cafes got their lights on

I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow

You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to

Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind

3 ContributorsHot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential "Yo! MTV Raps" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know

But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade

[Pre-Chorus]
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind: It was meant to be
And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn & Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weight
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to

When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well

I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact

Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

[Chorus]
Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

Some even fall to the earth

And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well

How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

Jumping up and down the floor
My head, is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all—duck"
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Wake yo' punk-ass up
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"
[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?
[Scratches]
​m.A.A.d city
Compton
[Outro]
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that2.2KEmbed

Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine

Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey ("Louder!")

56 ContributorsTake a Walk Lyrics[Verse 1]
All these kinds of places make it seem like it's been ages
Tomorrow, some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly, I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
Once, I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations
We were still alone, my wife and I
Before we married, saved my money, brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

[Pre-Chorus]
But off the boat, they stayed a while, then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most

[Chorus]
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Practice isn't perfect, but the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions, there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
Once, my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front
And, tonight, I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow, you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes
But, see, I am no criminal, I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need

*Ele foi o homem mais demente que conheci na vida*
*O fato de ele ser bonito, fez com que as pessoas não reparassem no grande vazio que ele tinha dentro de si*
*Um assassino carismático, que enganou até seus amigos íntimos*
A cobaia está pronta para testes

[VERSO 1: MBKILLA]
Yo
Ei você de saia, não saia, vem ser minha cobaia
Na praia, no laboratório do Ogaia
Rimo, me sinto Isaac Newton, físico, fico de tocaia
Eu juro, falei do passado, mas sei do futuro, calendário maia
Vai menor, larga o pó, se anima, assassina sua sina
Endorfina, a rima me dá e só
Onde está o Freddy Krueguer Junto com Jason Vorhees?
Sabe o boom? Sabe o grave? É só ouvir e seguir!
Encontre e chame o pânico, fala pros manos
Que tamo chegando, fi, tudo com lâmina
Cante o cântico, dance pra câmera, em cima da cama
Deu pane na placa da mente de gente babaca
Então vai, bota a cara, vai corre, não para
Que hoje me sinto com olhos famintos, ó, escuta o corvo!
Sem piedade, quem tem pena é galinha
Eu pra rimar pareço até um robô, mas vou lembrar de onde vim
Virar Super Sayajin pra me vingar
De quem achar que a minha saga está no fim!

Lobotomia do Dr. Friedkin, eu acho ótimo!
Sou Freddy, no ácido. Rápido, você é o próximo!
Breca sua meta, moleque aquieta, prega, cega
Nem vem com essa merda de "caga regra na tela"
Deixa eu injetar em ti um vírus do Haiti
Maluco, cão raivoso, som que bate igual brutality
Sou fruto do Doctor Frankestein... eu vejo mais
Meus "Olhos Famintos". Eu falo, não minto. Meus versos são velhos, mas são geniais
Tipo Einstein, Tesla brincando de estática
Adam Sandler, vários filmes, com a mesma temática
Não tem matemática pra te salvar, nem Bhaskara
Eu pego sua garota, e tiro onda, igual Máskara
Vivendo em Agrabah, tentando te agradar
Não vou parar, À Prova de Morte, eu vou é te atropelar!
É só paulada de som e eu to mais brabo que um monge
De longe, vaza, se esconde. Hits são vários no bong
Retardatários ao longe, vou te buscar em Hong Kong
Fique acordado e sonhe, trovões e raios ao longe!

[VERSO 3: MBK]
Tubo de ensaio é bong, até no ensaio meu bonde
Rima na régua, idéia reta, no alto do monte
Hipnotizar você, não tenho calma de monge
Meu novo nome é MBKamikazi, não é bomba
É só grave que late, acordei Bull Terrier
Se difamar minha família, corre, eu vou te morder
E a coleira cê trouxe, eu não uso, to relax
Igual Betthoven tocando piano junto com a Lassie
Uivaria a sinfonia por 10 milhas a pé
Com o amigo beagle fugitivo de São Tomé
Foragido por matar beat com a ponta da Bic
Por isso que eu vivo escondido em São José
Eu vivo com um vício por linha difícil
Tremi o edifícil com rima num míssil
Yeah, mordo doído e to latindo ainda
E caso tenha se ofendido, vem pedir meu impeachment!
[VERSO 4: Ogaia]

Já não me intimido mais, parei de dar ouvidos
Pra esse monte de cuzão que quer me ver fudido
Eu tenho um Gol quadrado, tu não tem quadrada, e eu miro
Ra-ta-tá! Tu curte outro tipo de "tiro"...
Vamo depenar a galinha?
Jantar de gala, terno, gravata e teus pedaço na mala
Coloca no porta mala do meu Opala, ou Impala, empalha
E te coloco no meio da minha sala
Não encerra a tortura, não emperra a minha fúria
A métrica fatia linha como serra elétrica
Michael Myers te empurrando dessa escada
Eu to tipo Stephen Hawking, então segura a cadeirada
Despressuriza a cabine, cuidado quem tem asma
Hóspede maldito não tem medo de fantasma
Pra vocês que tão na chuva e querem que o outro se molhe
Eu posso ser Polteirgeist ou Gasparzinho, aí você escolhe!

Dreams: that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

No matter what I say, I'm not over you

[Bridge]
And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...

1 ContributorWe’ll be coming back - calvin harris & example LyricsWe took it all apart
But I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away
But I miss the thing, are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Got to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day
You can see it from afar
We were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something not great
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away
But I miss the thing, are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Got to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, or ignore the stars
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you
Out of our minds
Got to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one daySee Example LiveGet tickets as low as $73You might also likeEmbed

58 ContributorsSo Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

[Post-Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile

Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile

Light reflects from your shadow
It is more than I thought could exist
You move through the room
Like breathing was easy
If someone believed me

I am learning about you
The things that no one else sees
And the end comes too soon
Like dreaming of angels
And leaving without them
And leaving without them

Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away (Blown away)

[Verse 2]
She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screamin' of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges

We tore up the walls, we slept on couches

I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene
