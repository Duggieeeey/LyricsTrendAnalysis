Reading the signs of my body (Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)
No fighting

[Chorus: Shakira  & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie (No fighting)
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy (Huh-uh)
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing (Yeah)
That when you walk up on the dance floor, nobody cannot ignore
The way you move your body, girl (Just smooth)
And everything's so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (Let's go)

Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)

Come on, let's go, real slow

How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You're dope, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

[Chorus 1: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want

Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?

But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team -- So does everybody else
Shh, baby, we can keep it on the low (Low)

To see if you can work me the way you say

I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

I said, who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a drivin' ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?

Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and starin' at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
"I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down"
And oh, he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feelin' in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah

Before Cam got the shit to pop

I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine

Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different

Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you, it's hard to survive

Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves

Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by yours
I've kissed your lips and held your hand
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay

But I’m doin’ It

But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart

My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I've been drinkin' and smokin'
Holy shit, cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po-po's scope this
Big old Excurs' just swervin', all up in the curb and
Nigga be sippin' on the Hennessy and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt and roll another one up
We livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the lowkey
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, "Fuck 'em all"
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, and get it poppin', dawg
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire
[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Now would you think it's so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
Keep steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags (Tags)
Pull me over, try to check my slab (Slab)
The glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Jammin' number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, tell 'em, "We hate you"
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home
And it's on
[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty54Embed

Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me

Come find me
Make up your mind

Should I let you fall, lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself
Can't keep believing, we're only deceiving ourselves
And I'm sick of the lie

Drinkin' on some Rossi, Jon on Patrón
VIP status, strapped wit my chrome
Look around the club, what do I see
Everybody rockin' side to side to the beat
Snappin' they fingers, bouncin' to the groove
All by they self, that's the new move
Nigga, where I'm from, we like to go dumb
I'm soakin' up the game, I'm seein' how it's done
I ask shawty what they call it, she said 'the Pool Palace'
Straight from Bankhead, I said 'you good at it'
Do what'cha do, you and ya crew
They even got playa's and thugs doin' it too
The mo' that I drank, the more it's lookin' smooth

Rollin' up the kush, put it in the air
I'm throwin' up the E's to let 'em know we in here
Brand new shoes, brand new tool
Pull out the ol' school 'cause I'm feelin' real cool
Yeah I'm from the 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin'
Snappin' my fingers, then reachin' for my Glock BITCH!
Reppin' my block BITCH!, straight from the Dec
When you snap ya fingers shawty, gotta jerk ya neck
Smokin' on the best, we don't fuck wit dat mess
I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this
Yeah I'm back to the track, back to the snap

This is how we do it in the A town
(And if you ain't know) This is how it goes down

May be the reason that all these teenies may never see me

C'mon (C'mon)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & (Beyoncé)]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Seeing things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me, almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losin' it

Baby girl, you should already know

Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind, I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you

Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now
You got someone to blame?
You say one love, one life (One life)
It's one need in the night (In the night)
One love (One love), we get to share it (Oh)
Leaves you darlin', if you don't care for it

[Verse 2: Mary J Blige]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without?
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?
Well, did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
See, we hurt each other, then we do it again
You say love is a temple, love is a higher law
Love is a temple, love is a higher law
You ask for me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't keep holding on to what you've got
'Cause all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other

One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking

With a big black horse and a cherry tree

I said, "Don't look back, just keep on walking"

Well, the big black horse said, "Look this way"
He said, "Hey lil' lady, will you marry me?"

Before I turn around and spray your ass with mace (Oh, shit)
My lips make you wanna have a taste (Oh, shit)
You got that? I got the bass

[Verse 1]
All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 2]
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya!"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late."
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and "Thank you all for comin' out"
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
"But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?"
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'."
"But baby, wait!" – "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real."
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

I said, "Ciara's on your radio
Everybody turn it up"

Get it, make your body rock

But you just can't fight the feeling inside

By the way that you was watchin' me

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
It's the kid that stay ridin' big
The one police tried to catch ridin' dirty
In the club before eleven o'clock
Like I'm tryna catch a dime kinda early
Lookin' thick, her hair brown and curly
She love the way my ride shinin' pearly
City boys say she fine and pretty
And the country boys say she fine and purty (Yeah)
My pockets thick, it's green, it's curvy
And the ladies know soon as they see my jewelry
If bein' fresh to death is a crime
I think it's time for me to see the jury
You know Chamillionaire stay on the grind
A hustler like me is hard to find
I ain't really impressed, yes
Unless it's about some dollar signs
Ain't really no need to call you fine

Watchin' you do your step, do your step
And yep, it's going down

Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair
In '77 and '69
Revolution was in the air
I was born too late
To a world that doesn’t care
Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker
With flowers in my hair

[Verse 1]
When the head of state didn’t play guitar
Not everybody drove a car
When music really mattered
And when radio was king
When accountants didn’t have control
And the media couldn’t buy your soul
And computers were still scary and
We didn’t know everything

And playing games meant kick arounds
And footballers still had long hair
And dirt across their face

They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, "Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself tryin' to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot working my day around a call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

[Chorus: Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But, now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine and I'm planning to keep it that way
And you can call me if you find that you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Please come back home

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it
[Chorus: Holly Brook & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

25 ContributorsI Don’t Feel Like Dancin’ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning with a head like, "What ya done?"
This used to be the life, but I don't need another one
You like cuttin' up and carryin' on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up gettin' down?

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You'd better move when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like the magic's only ours tonight

[Chorus]
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today
I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you

[Verse 2]
Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colours it'd make a blind man so confused
So why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I'd lose?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around, I'm sure that I'll be fine

[Chorus]
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance, but my two feet can't find a way

I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you

[Bridge]
You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer lights

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays

What if I told you it was all meant to be

Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me

Everything changes, but beauty remains
Somethings so tender, I can't explain

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top (Uh-huh)
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (Oh), in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh), in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I
Open up your mouth, your grill gleamin' (Say what?)

Some say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you its only seed

[Verse 2]
It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

[Verse 3]
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the roseSee Westlife LiveGet tickets as low as $85You might also likeEmbed

For every piece of me that wants you
Another piece backs away

Just to spend a little time alone with me
And I can say I've never bought you flowers

That was someone else's dream

7 ContributorsWhat’s Left of Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Watch my life pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time, are becoming clearer
I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
Yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

[Verse 2]
I've been dying inside
Little by little
Nowhere to go, but going out of my mind
In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still

[Chorus]
And I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

Falling faster, barely breathing
Give me something to believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head
Take what's left of this man
Make me whole, once again

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
You can have all that's left
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What's left of me
Oh, oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
I've been dying inside, you see
I'm going out of my mind, out of my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Just running in circles in my mind
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left?
Will you take what's left of me?
Take what's left of me9Embed

19 ContributorsAmerica Lyrics[Verse 1]
What a drag it is
The shape I'm in
Well I go out somewhere
Then I come home again
I light a cigarette
Cause I can't get no sleep
There's nothing on the TV nothing on the radio
That means that much to me

[Hook]
All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
There's trouble in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh

[Verse 2]
Yesterday was easy
Happiness came and went
I got the movie script
But I don't know what it meant
I light a cigarette
Cause I can't get no sleep
There's nothing on the TV, nothing on the radio
That means that much to me
There's nothing on the TV nothing on the radio
That I can believe in

No me puedo controlar
Aqui con el Señor LL Cool J
Y aqui estoy... ya tu sabes

[Jermaine Dupri]
Ya'll know what this is...So...So...Def!

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled
She said

Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 2: LL Cool J with Jennifer Lopez]
Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic
Her gaze was so hypnotic
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the after party is at my body
Meet me you're invited

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth
Side, to side, and up, and down
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you
