There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"

Come on, let your colors burst

It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on with the best of 'em

Like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name

Even now, when we're already over

It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that

Girl the way you're movin'

And you 'gon lose dem pants
Then I'ma throw this money

All I want to do is sit back
And watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash

[Waka Flocka Flame]

All that ass

Long hair she don't care
When she walk she get stares
Brown skin or a yellow-bone
DJ this my favorite song
So I'ma make it thunderstorm
Flood warning, Flocka yea
Blowin' fuck it I dont care
Dreads is flyin' everywhere
Tap my partner Roscoe, like bruh
I'm drunk as hell, can't you tell?
Threw 70 bands, bet 50 stacks
Oh fuckin' well
I'm tryna hit the hotel
With 2 girls that swallow me
Take this dick while I'm swallow
Moscato got her freaky
Hey you got me in a trance
Please take off yo pants
Pussy pop on her handstand
You got me sweatin'
Please pass me a fan, damn!

To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' "don't go"

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening

And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, "fuck it"
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish

That's the way it goes when you party just like I do

Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now

I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
But there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I'll mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now, I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I know I can't take one more step towards you
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore?
You lost the love I love the most

And now you want me one more time

You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me

Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture

But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery

Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt

I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight

Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start

45 ContributorsTonight Tonight Lyrics[Intro]
Uno, dos, tres

[Verse 1]
It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her

[Pre-Chorus]
La, la, la, whatever
La, la, la, it doesn't matter
La, la, la, oh, well
La, la, la

[Chorus]
We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight, tonight, and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
Woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it
Not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis, huh

Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth, hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh (Ha ha) put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats, then get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold, don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Gon' and put your hands up, when times is hard, you stand up
L-U-P the man, 'cause the brand that the fans trust

Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rappin' round the world for

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm gettin' so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say anything I don't mean
Like, "What's up with your best friend? We could all have some fun, believe me"
And, "What's up with these new niggas? And why'd they think it all comes so easy?"
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah, and I'll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tan and my hair long and my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fuckin' allegations
I'm just feelin' like the throne is for the takin' (Watch me take it)

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done

Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you, "Everything is great" (Right)
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing eight
Still runnin' with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully (Ha-ha)
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams (Woo)
In a room full of money out in London as she screams? (Woo)

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

I need a doctor, doctor

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream:
"Dre, don't leave us like that, man", 'cause—

It doesn't matter if you love him

Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say

Cut the music up
A little louder, yeah

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip "dick," you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause "cock" backwards is still "cock," you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzz and
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known that from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9", but I feel like I’m 6'8"

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
By the time you hear this, I’ll prolly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: "Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!"
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oww, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On the radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I'd like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home

17 ContributorsWherever You Will Go LyricsSo lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall, and fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone, could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out a way to make it back, someday
To watch you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall, and fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will...

No! Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind, I'll stay with you for all of time
You might also likeIf I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

I'll go wherever you will go

Yo, you might hear me make a racket like Wilson
Cause I love summer, no Rachel Bilson (Yes)
The winter will come
We just have parties inside, it's still fun
(We're jamming) pump this (We're banging)
Change your boyfriend let's have him
We're rowdy, girls make our judgement cloudy
But when the sun comes through we're still alcys
We don't wanna be lousy, or shameless
But we're running round like we're brainless
Now I've got grass stains on my brand-new white trainers
(On my brand new white trainers)
Ummmm… I know a few guys hate us
They're as compelling as Neighbours so laters
It's blaters we've got our own sound, you know now
So go wild and get hosed down, n-no no

Move in and move quick (When I dance)

You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me "Lip Parade"
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

Lyrics:
19 ContributorsL.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N. Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips
She's a rock'n'roll survivor with pendulum hips
She's got deep brown eyes that've seen it all

Working at a nightclub that was called "The Avenue"
The bar men used to call her "Little Lisa, Looney Tunes"
She went down on almost anyone

And from the hard time living 'til the Chelsea days
From when her hair was sweet blonde 'til the day it turned gray
She said

[Chorus]
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you go in your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you go in your own way

[Verse 2]
Some people wear their history like a map on their face
And Joey was an artist just living out of case
But his best work was his letters home
Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
When chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal

And from the hard time living to the sleepless nights
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
He'd say

[Chorus]
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you go in your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you go in your own way

[Bridge]
On my last night on Earth, I won't look to the sky
Just breathe in the air and blink in the light
On my last night on Earth, I'll pay a high price
To have no regrets and be done with my life

[Chorus]
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you go in your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you go in your own wayYou might also like6Embed

Audi R8, laid back, Black on Black
Diamonds on my neck and my wrist matching that
Black mask, black mag, brown bag
Drop that off, nigga, shoot your black ass
I'm a magnet to money, the paper I'm where it's at
They attracted to me, they treat me like Pimp C
I'm a P-I-M-P, your chick just chose me
I got so much swag, is that why you mad?
Control your hatred, nothing good to say, don't say shit
Keep walkin', quit talkin', keep it movin'
We can keep the club jumpin' 'till daylight
From New York to LA through the Bay right

Stack cash and laugh like L-O-L

I can't control this feeling
Something's happening inside me
Our senses come alive
The chemistry is building
It's something that we're feeling
There's nowhere you can hide

[Hook]
It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
We're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get stronger
We're gonna feel, we're gonna feel, we're gonna feel better
You can't tame this energy inside
We gotta reach, we gotta reach, we gotta reach higher
I wanna burn, wanna burn, burn like a fire
We gotta move, gotta move, gotta move faster
You can't tame this energy inside

A shadow in the night

Watch it ignite as we open our eye, it's the one way we know to survive
We're powerfully changing the world we're reclaiming, our unity they can't divide
They push us around but we're tearing it down and we're having the time of our life
